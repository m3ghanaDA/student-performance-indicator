## End to end machine learning project on Student performance predictor
Student Performance Predictor | Python, Machine Learning 
• Designed and implemented a comprehensive machine learning project to predict student performance, achieving an
accuracy of 87.97% by analyzing over 1000 data points across multiple factors.
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implemented robust data ingestion and transformation pipelines,
reducing data processing time by 30% and ensuring seamless integration and scalability.
• Performed model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, resulting in a 15% improvement in model accuracy
through iterative optimization techniques.
• Developed and deployed a fully functional prediction pipeline using Flask, integrated with Azure cloud services, and
automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
